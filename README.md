Breast cancer is a life-threatening disease arising predominantly from the aberrant pro-liferation of cells lining the breast's milk ducts. Despite being more prevalent in women, it can also affect men (Cutress, 2023). Prompt detection and treatment can significantly enhance breast cancer survival rates, necessitating improved early detection method-ologies. Current detection approaches, such as diagnostic mammography, may be im-peded by various challenges, including dense breast tissue in some women many im-ages need to be taken and it is difficult for a large number of audiences (Rabiei et al., 2022). In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a robust tool in healthcare, offering significant potential for early disease prediction by deriving knowledge from da-ta and uncovering hidden patterns. Previous studies have used different data types for breast cancer prediction, including mammographic characteristics, biopsy data, demo-graphic risk variables, and genetic information.(Boeri et al., 2020; Rabiei et al., 2022). 
In this project, the primary aim was to develop a robust and efficient machine-learning model to improve the speed and accuracy of breast cancer prediction. A range of Py-thon libraries and tools were employed for data manipulation, visualization, and deep learning model development. Three diverse datasets were utilized: Mammographic Da-ta for binary classification of benign and malignant masses, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) for image classification, and histopathological data for another image classification task. The Mammographic Data underwent pre-processing to handle missing values, and four machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Na√Øve Bayes) were evaluated, with Random Forest emerging as the top performer with 82.25% accuracy. The CBIS-DDSM dataset was cleaned, and images were resized and normalized. The histopathological dataset underwent a similar treatment, and both image datasets were merged and expanded through data augmentation. Combining two different types of datasets helped my model to work for a large variety of breast cancer images because most of the breast cancer images were taken in both formats.  For image classification, three convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures (CNN, ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG) were examined, with CNN delivering superior perfor-mance with 89.14% accuracy. Both models were integrated into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to predict breast cancer conditions from mammographic data and images. 
In summary, this project successfully developed a robust machine-learning system for breast cancer prediction, integrating diverse datasets and employing both traditional machine learning and deep learning models. The optimized Random Forest model for mammographic data and the CNN model for image data showcased exceptional pre-dictive performance. The user-friendly web application further enhances accessibility, making this project a valuable contribution to the field of medical diagnostics and the quest for early breast cancer detection.
